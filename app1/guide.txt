You can examine the url through several Request fields:

A user requests the following URL:

    http://www.example.com/myapplication/page.html?x=y
In this case the values of the above mentioned attributes would be the following:

    path             /page.html
    script_root      /myapplication
    base_url         http://www.example.com/myapplication/page.html
    url              http://www.example.com/myapplication/page.html?x=y
    url_root         http://www.example.com/myapplication/
You can easily extract the host part with the appropriate splits.
